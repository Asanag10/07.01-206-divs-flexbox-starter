                I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I have four children and two grand children. I come from a very close knit family. My mom is the oldest of six. She has a heart of gold and is the glue that holds the family together.

            <div class="div-2">
                My Passion: I am so grateful for how the Lord keeps me and my family. He is my Sustainer, Provision, Protection and His love is irreplaceable. Any favor or blessings my family and I have received is because of Him.

            <div class="div-3">
                A fun-fact: I have ALWAYS, ALWAYS wanted to join a roller derby league. Although it's a contact sport, I think it's super cool. It's for all ages, sizes and shapes. It is definitely one of the top ten on my bucket list!
